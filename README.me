🚢Titanic Survival Predictor
This project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to build a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input passenger details and get real-time survival predictions.

🔍 Features
✅ Logistic Regression classifier
✅ Label Encoding for categorical variables
✅ Streamlit UI for interactive prediction
✅ Model and encoders serialized with pickle
